  information 
[ who, buy/sell, amount, what, price ]

Market characteristics
- All participants are price takers. Orders execute immediately at the market
  price.
- All price movements are simulated by the server. (affected by other players
  actions)
- Spontaneous price movements do occur, to simulate activity of hidden players,
  but the main focus should be player vs. player interaction. Still have to
  have a significant random component so that one player can't manipulate the
  overall volatility by injecting or withholding liquidity.
- Potential black swan events. Crash one stock, etc. Can make this limitlessly
  complex by adding more events and triggers... simulate algo trades.
